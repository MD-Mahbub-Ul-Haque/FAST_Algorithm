Here this Codes are for explaining the FAST Algorithm
--> fast_steps.py SHOWS step by step algorithm
--> fast_photo.py SHOWS corner detections on a photo
--> fast_webcam.py SHOWS live corner detection on webcam
--> fast_detection01.py SHOWS live object (hand) recognation using webcam 


In the fast_step.py you have to change the image path according to your storage.
